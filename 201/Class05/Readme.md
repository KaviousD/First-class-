# Images in HTML

<p> when adding simple images we use the <img> element also considered a void element uses (src and alt).

- <img src="dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" /s> for same directory <img src="images/dinosaur.jpg" alt="Dinosaur" /> for subdirectory

# alternative text

- The alt attribute closely link the name to the image and is displayed on the webpage.

# image titles

- we can add a title attribute to images when more info is needed

# Example:

<img src="images/naruto.jpg
alt="The shinobi hokage; the strongest ninja"
width="400"
height="341"
title="A ninja with a rasengan"/>

# HTML Media Using Images In HTML, and Reading Common Image Types and Choosing Image Formats.

What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

        + In real world context i would use the alt attribute to show a text description,  in the chance there is a error in the code so they would have a description of the image.

How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

       + Instead of trying to fix the image to fit all online users we instead impove the text linked to the image so that users that forinstance have issues seeing the image will have a caption of the image.

Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

        + The figure element would be useful when creating a semantic container for figures, to clearly link the figure to the caption.

Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

        Well a gif image is considered a image/ animation that has been compressed to a smaller size for all user display. A svg is sappose to be more of a created image using lines through a code can color is added later.

What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

        I would use the normal png type because it is more common and that fact i have more practice using this format than webp.

# Learn CSS / Using Color in CSS. Styling HTML Text Elements

Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

        I would tell them the foreground content is the color of the text content and the background colors affect the color/image inserted to the back of the webpage.

Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

        First i would add some changes too his bacground color and ajust the text color to stand out with the background color. Then i would add some margin and padding additions to even the content with the page.

What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

        We should consider if the font is web safe meaning the website can render the font when the code is displaying the content on the page.

What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

        Font-size allows you to increase the size of the text words, Font weight allows you to set how bold the text will be being normal to heavy, and font style allows you to set the text to italics.

Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

        We could add space between the letters using the letter-spacing in css projected towards the heading in css or we can add space between the words using word-spacing element in css to space out word for desired looks.
