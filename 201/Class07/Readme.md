# Domain Modeling
Explain why we need domain modeling.
We need domain modelling to create a model of projects we have this method helps solve problems in a diagram type of way. We can also use the model add new ideas later to the site.

# HTML Table Basics

Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

+ We shouldnt use tables for page layouts because the normal function of the table is to store and display data. First it deceases the accessibility for he visual impaired and other disabled users, second it can creat soup which i assume is saying tables are complex and can mess with your code, finally tables are not automatically responsive.

List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

+ The “TH” element stands for 'table header’  except that it denotes a header, not a normal cell. The “col” element is specified inside the colgroup container just below the opening “table” tag a easier way of adding css instead of individual boxed. The “Tr” element stop a row from growing and start placing cells on a second row.

# Introducing Constructors

What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

+ A constructor is just a function called when using the “new” keyword we can create a new object while binding “this.” to the new object, so we can refer to this later in code

How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

+ The ‘this” term when used in object literal can be used to define only for singular purposes however when using a constructor we can create multiple instances using the “new” keyword

# Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

+ I believe prototypes are the classes that care created in code and when we call back those classes from different instances in to the new branch we call this inheritance
