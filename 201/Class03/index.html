    <article> Hello, my name is the obvious moment. I graduated from Middlecollegehighschool class of 2021 leaving with my high school diploma I searched for the next objective to complete only finding obstacles. I have realized that a lot of higher-paying jobs require a certification of some sort to qualify for the position. I'm currently a young investor that likes to code as you can tell. Today we learned a lot about using HTML to create interaction among users. I was born in Memphis and my favorite sport is basketball. Never had the chance to go to college due to financial issues but I will make the most of the coding opportunity presented in front of me.
