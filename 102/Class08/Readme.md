# Expresions and operators

+ expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions those that assign values and those that evaluate.

## Example 

the expression x = 7 uses the (=) operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. it evaluates to 7.

The expression 3 + 4 is an example of the second type. Which simply evaluates the expression. 

# Assignment operators

+ an assignment operator assigns a value to its left side of sign based on the value of its right side.
    
    
    ## Diffrent operator functions
        + Assignment x = f()<
        + Addition assignment x += f()	
        + Subtraction assignment x -= f()	
        + Division assignment x *= f()	
        + Multiplication assignment x /= f()
        + Remainder assignment x %= f()	
        + Exponentiation assignment x **= f()
        + Left shift assignment x <<= f()	
        + right shift assignment x >>= f()	
        + Unsigned right shift assignment x >>>= f()	
        + Bitwise AND assignment x &= f()	
        + Bitwise XOR assignment x ^= f()	
        + Bitwise OR assignment x |= f()	
        + Logical AND assignment x &&= f()	
        + Logical OR assignment x ||= f()	
        + Nullish coalescing assignment x ??= f()	

# Comparison operators

+ A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

+ === and !== operators perform strict equality and inequality comparison
