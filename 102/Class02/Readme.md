# Mastering and Explaning Github Lingo
Here i will be creatig a blog like text using visual studios to explain alittle about the coding lingo aswell anwsering question regarding the read 01 markdown.

# Headings

The Hash tag key or the (#) key determines the size of the heading can be one to six (More makes the heading smaller).

## Example:

Level 1:

# header

Level 2:

## header

Level 3:

### header
 
# Styling 

When committing to styling with your text it's better to play around witht the style because there are many options for your coding experience.

## Part 1

Bolding - when using bolding or creating a more darker text we use two syntax tools to display this either the (** **) keys, or (__ __)these keys to create a bolded text.

## Bold text example

The **butterflies** are out.

The __butterflies__ are out.

# Italics

Italics- when creating italics it important to use only when trying to implie this piece of text is important or for foreign/important code words.

## Italics Example

The *Ðàn Tre* is a good instrament.

The *Ðàn Tre* is a good instrament

# Strikethrough

Strikethrough- The purpose of a strikethrough is to delete or cross out a mistaken part of a text or code. Format: "~~ ~~"

## Strikethrough Example

The cat was running through the ~~house~~ "house" all night

# Combinations and more

Now that we have all the skill down we can work on the combos and more fun styling. you can actually combine the italics and bolding feature to fully bold and italic a full script or just partially.

# Example

**The _Ðàn Tre_ is a good instrament**

Only the intrament is italicized.

***The Ðàn Tre is a good instrament***

By adding three (*) to the start and end of the sentence you can both italicize and bold the text.

# Subscript

Subscript- when using sub script it important to know it is the smallest text and should only be used as a underliying statement. There are also supersuscripts which are only a step higher.

# Example 

Normal sub- format: <sub></sub>

The course will be **Manditory** for all students. 

<sub> (The Leaders will also with hold this information for student that need further assistance.)</sub>

Super sub-  format: <sup></sup>

The course will be **Manditory** for all students.

<sup> (The Leaders will also with hold this information for student that need further assistance.)</sup>

# Quoting text

Quoting text- quoting text is a important technique used to include information from outside sources or when you are quoting something important.

## Example

Thus this statement is not quoted

> Thus this statement is quoted

# Link creation and modification 

Links- One of the more useful and fun tips that is very fun and useful later on. to describe it link are everywhere throughout the internet. However, I will be only using only the Url.

## Example 

When trying to link your website to a set title for research purposes we you this format. Format: " Name[reffrence site name](Sites URL) "

You can find out more using [Basic writing](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)  

# Relative Links

The way relative link work are i can help new readers to navigate through my repository. Using the same set-up as the creating a link just pasting your git hub link withing the parenthisis.

## Example 

My personal Github page [Github](https://github.com/KaviousD)
  
  Addig a diffrent link and change the location within my repository.

# Images

When inserting images you have to make sure you dont just include the link. There are other steps that can be taken to add the picture to this here Repo. Format: ![This is an image](Then add your desired url here)

## Example: 

![This is an image](https://pm1.narvii.com/5968/a0eece8f15626fe96ae9824d88bc66d4a0b608dc_hq.jpg)

# Creating multiple list 

When creating list there are many diffrent ways to make them using commands. Format: +,*,- (with a spacebefore texting).

## Example

- Spiderman
* superman
+ clothman

<sub> Note you can also do this with Numbers</sub> 

## Example 
 Same way as above but with numbers.

    1. quincy adams
    2. Mozart
    3. The locals

# Nested Lists 
 When creating a nested list you can add multiple method this method you have to use the **Tab key**  after each bullet then apply a (- or *) to make the sub points.
1. first item 
    * first nest
        * second nest
            
# Creating task list 

Creating task list can be very useful when doing multiple things at one to create a task list simply add a hyphen followed by []. Then simply place a x in the box when a task is completed.

- [x] Complete my 204
- [ ] Complete my Github page
- [ ] Update my music list 

# Mentioning your people and teams

Mentioning a team member function is very helpful when allowing other team members or classmates to your repositories. You can do this by (@) your team member or classmates name next to the at symbol.
 
 # Adding Emojis to notes

# Footnotes

Foot notes are a hand tool that allows us to keep minor notes at the bottom of the page. You can use them by enteringa number into the syntax bracket below "[^1]"

## Example 

I added my **Secret** code to the repo [^1] 

## Things I want to know more about

In coding theres a variety of uses when it comes to coding
